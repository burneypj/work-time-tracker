# work-time-tracker

The **work-time-tracker (wtt)** is a desktop application built using Python and PyQt5 to help users track their work sessions, export session data to Excel, and manage session data efficiently. It includes features like session monitoring, inactivity detection, and exporting data with customizable configurations.

## Features

1. **Session Tracking**:
   - Start and stop work sessions.
   - Automatically log session start and end times, along with the duration.

2. **Inactivity Monitoring**:
   - Automatically stop sessions when the user is idle for a configurable threshold.
   - Resume sessions when activity is detected.

3. **Windows Lock/Unlock Detection**:
   - Automatically stop sessions when the system is locked.
   - Resume sessions when the system is unlocked.

4. **Export to Excel**:
   - Export session data to an Excel file.
   - Configure export settings, including sheet name, starting date, and cell mappings.
   - Supports date-based and flat data exports.

5. **System Tray Integration**:
   - Minimize the application to the system tray.
   - Start/stop sessions and restore the application from the tray.

6. **Configuration Management**:
   - Save and load user preferences, such as export settings and database paths, using a JSON configuration file.

7. **Reset Functionality**:
   - A **Reset** button allows users to delete all session data and configuration files.
   - Displays a confirmation dialog before proceeding.
   - Closes the application after resetting.

## Configuration

The application saves user preferences in a JSON file located at:
```
~\time_tracker_config.json
```

### Configurable Settings
- `wb_sheet`: Default Excel sheet name.
- `date_cell`, `start_cell`, `end_cell`, `duration_cell`: Default cell mappings for export.
- `date_based_export`: Whether to use date-based export formatting.
- `excel_path`: Path to the last used Excel file.
- `db_path`: Path to the database file.
- `minimized`: Whether the application starts minimized.

## Database Schema

The SQLite database contains a single table:

### `work_sessions`
| Column      | Type    | Description                     |
|-------------|---------|---------------------------------|
| `id`        | INTEGER | Primary key (auto-increment).   |
| `start_time`| TEXT    | Session start time (ISO format).|
| `end_time`  | TEXT    | Session end time (ISO format).  |
| `duration`  | TEXT    | Session duration (in seconds).  |

---

## Utility Functions

### utils.py
- **`increment_cell_row(cell_ref)`**:
  - Increments the row number in an Excel cell reference (e.g., `A1` â†’ `A2`).
- **`format_duration(seconds)`**:
  - Converts a duration in seconds to `HH:MM:SS` format.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for weekly and monthly summary reports.
- Enable cloud synchronization for session data.
- Add more export formats (e.g., CSV, PDF).
